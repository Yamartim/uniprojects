# uniprojects
Portfolio of many projects I made for my degree, as well as some random things I'm testing to learn how they work

Projects made for many disciplines and internet online courses such as
  - Programming and algorithm construction, 
  - Object oriented programming, 
  - Algorithms and data structures, 
  - Organization and recovery of information

It's a bit unnorganized at the moment, but I'm still getting my bearings so I'll organize it soon!
